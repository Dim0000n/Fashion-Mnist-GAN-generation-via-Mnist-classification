# Fashion-Mnist-GAN-generation-via-Mnist-classification

Hello, everybody!

I trained GAN to generate different Fashion Mnist items via conditional label of classes (0..9) in thsi work. These labels were extract from Mnist handwritten digits.

The digit is inputted to the fully-connected classificator to recognize the label. Then the label is served like the condition for the generator to create certain fashion item.

I will by glad if you can find it interesting.

Have a nice day!
Dmitrii Utev.
